This repository contains information about Evaluating Software Maintainability through CK Metrics: An Empirical Study on Open-Source Java Projects
**#ABSTRACT**
This study's goal is to assess software maintainability with an emphasis on open-source Java projects by utilizing the Chidamber and Kemerer (C&K) metrics package. We analyze important metrics that are known to affect maintainability, such as Weighted Methods per Class (WMC) and Coupling Between Object Classes (CBO), using a static analysis on a carefully chosen dataset of Java applications
**#Research Questions**
1)How do the software maintainability metrics of WMC and CBO relate to class size?
2)How does class size impact the ease of modification and refactoring in terms of maintainability?
**#Results**
The results of the study clearly show that class size has a major impact on how maintainable software systems are. Higher levels of complexity (WMC) and increased coupling (CBO), two important measures of how readily the software may be expanded, altered, or debugged, are consistently linked to larger classes.
